  2007-03-23 06:16:24 (r2183) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Time for a new release! 

  2007-03-23 05:41:58 (r2182) by rcaputo; extras/wiki/index.cgi M

    Expand the spam hosts we deny. 

  2007-03-23 05:41:09 (r2181) by rcaputo; extras/wiki/purplehaze.css A

    Add some evil to deal with del.icio.us tagometer issues.

  extras/wiki/data/templates/footer.html M;

    Add del.icio.us tagometer. 

  2007-03-21 07:55:15 (r2179) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Eric Busto discovered that POE::Wheel::Run depended on $/ to be the
    default. This is not always the case, and deviations result in new()
    hanging forever. 

  2007-03-18 20:16:17 (r2178) by rcaputo; poe/Makefile.PL M

    Some package tools expect Makefile.PL to return 1. And since this is
    a return and not an exit, it makes more sense than 0. Thanks to
    Rafael Kitover for pointing this out. 

  2007-03-17 20:20:01 (r2177) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Lukas Mai discovered a bug in the include .inputrc directive and was
    kind enough to submit a patch. 

  2007-03-12 17:11:46 (r2176) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadWrite.pm M

    An anonymous poster to POE's mailing list pointed out that put()'s
    implementation didn't match its documentation. So I corrected the
    documentation. 

  2007-02-24 20:23:30 (r2175) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Fix a doc bug found by Randal Schwartz.

  2007-02-20 23:13:48 (r2174) by teknikill
  poe/t/90_regression/rt1648-tied-stderr.t M

    switch to a more portable way of emitting STDERR in a subprocess

  poe/lib/POE/Loop/IO_Poll.pm M; poe/t/10_units/03_base/02_api_ctl.t M;
  poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Stop setting $^W globally. Fix a couple warnings as a result. Thanks
    to Ton Hospel for pointing out we were doing this. 

  2007-02-03 07:16:01 (r2172) by bingosnet; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Rolled back changes to POE::Wheel::Run

  2007-01-18 19:51:37 (r2171) by rcaputo
  poe/t/10_units/01_pod/02_pod_coverage.t M

    Only enable this test when Test::Pod::Coverage 1.08 or later is
    installed. Resolves rt.cpan.org #24375, reported by Jean-Christophe
    Zeus. 

  2007-01-18 19:31:11 (r2170) by rcaputo
  poe/t/30_loops/00_base/wheel_readline.pm M

    Rafael Kitover found out that some .inputrc entries can break the
    Wheel::ReadLine test. This change sets $ENV{INPUTRC} to a nonexistent
    file, which effectively disables .inputrc redefines. 

  2007-01-14 18:09:57 (r2169) by bingosnet; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Documented new POE::Wheel::Run MSWin32 behaviour

  2007-01-14 05:59:10 (r2168) by rcaputo
  poe/t/90_regression/whjackson-followtail.t M

    Skip this test if the underlying OS can't rename open files.

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M; poe/t/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M

    MSWin32 hacks to POE::Wheel::Run to use Win32::Process to spawn a
    separate process. Skipped tk_wheel_run test on MSWin32, which is
    causing hangs on AS perl

===========================

  2007-01-03 17:29:46 (r2165) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Bump the version to test sourceforge's new subversion server. 

  2007-01-03 07:14:30 (r2164) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Release the hounds! Or at least the code... 

  2007-01-03 06:13:16 (r2163) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm M

    Rob Bloodgood supplied a test for an error when shutting down Tk with
    the window manager's "close window" on a Tk main window. I was able
    to reproduce and resolve the issue, reported as rt.cpan.org ticket
    #21754. 

  2007-01-01 08:38:53 (r2162) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm M

    Clear the $heap->{connected} flag on shutdown. Reported by Paul Evans
    in rt.cpan.org ticket 22832. 

  2006-12-31 23:25:59 (r2161) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    Add Whitney Jackson's test case to the MANIFEST. D'oh! 

  2006-12-31 21:35:35 (r2160) by rcaputo
  poe/t/90_regression/whjackson-followtail.t A;
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/FollowTail.pm M

    Add a test case and apply a patch by Whitney Jackson. FollowTail
    would miss data appended to a log file if the file is rolled before
    the next check. His patch ensures the old file is read to the end
    before the rotation occurs. 

  2006-11-30 01:53:55 (r2159) by immute; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Finally removed all traces of new() from the POE::Session docs.

  2006-11-16 17:20:49 (r2158) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    Fixed a typo.

  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Signals.pm M;
  poe/t/90_regression/rt23181-sigchld-rc.t A; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M;
  poe/MANIFEST M

    Philip Gwyn discovered that sig_child($pid) without a corresponding
    prior sig_child($pid,"event") would drop a session's reference count
    below zero. This commit adds a new accessor to POE::Resource::Signals
    and a check whether the session is watching the PID before attempting
    to clear it. The check will slow down sig_child($pid) calls slightly,
    but they're not actually needed most of the time since POE should
    clear those one-shot events for you. 

  2006-11-14 08:32:08 (r2156) by bingosnet; extras/smoker.perl M

    Updated smoker.perl to use sig_child()

  2006-11-12 07:01:34 (r2155) by teknikill; poe/lib/POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm M

    added get_one interface to HTTPD filter

  poe/t/10_units/03_base/13_assert_data.t M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Add a nonfatal mode to the resolver explainer function, so that alias
    accessors don't throw errors even with asserts enabled. A big shout
    out to Rob Bloodgood for this one. 

  2006-11-04 01:58:24 (r2153) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE.pm M; poe/t/30_loops/00_base/all_errors.pm M

    Remove references to POE::Preprocessor. Point to Filter::Template
    instead.

  2006-11-03 07:06:36 (r2150) by rcaputo
  poe/t/30_loops/00_base/wheel_readline.pm M

    Skip Wheel::ReadLine tests when poll() is in play on MacOS X. For
    some reason poll() returns POLLNVAL when multiplexing TTYs. 

  2006-11-03 02:45:24 (r2149) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/IO_Poll.pm M

    The IO::Poll loop would busy loop without reporting errors on handles
    that were closed. 

  2006-11-03 02:44:08 (r2148) by rcaputo; poe/Makefile.PL M

    Improve the prompts for skipping network tests.

    (Also altered paths in mylib/*.perl and the test files themselves to
    match.) * Removed test.pl and setup Makefile.PL (& Makefile-500?.pm)
    to run the tests

    directly with Test::Harness.

    Moved the MSWin32 optional requirements to core requirements.
    libwin32 installs correctly from CPAN as a dependency on
    Vanilla/Strawberry now. 

  2006-10-30 16:33:03 (r2145) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Filter/Stackable.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Filter.pm M

    Removed the isa("POE::Filter") check from POE::Filter::Stackable.
    While technically correct, it catches the kind of error that arises
    in early development and isn't all that hard to figure out.
    
    Amended the PUBLIC FILTER METHODS documentation in POE::Filter to
    recommend inheriting some base methods from POE::Filter rather than
    implementing all of them in every subclass.
    
    Resolves rt.cpan.org 22633, reported by Joel Bernstein. 

  2006-10-17 16:49:07 (r2144) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Driver/SysRW.pm M

    Avoid warnings if the result of a sysread() is undefined. Resolves

  2006-10-03 03:13:53 (r2141) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Matt Trout strongly suggests that version numbers should have a
    consistent number of decimal places so that they are both lexically
    and numerically monotonic. 

  2006-10-01 17:10:40 (r2140) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loader.pm A

    I found this (unused) module in a Pod::Coverage sweep. I'm committing
    it because it looks useful, but it's not part of POE's distribution
    yet. 

  2006-10-01 17:07:59 (r2139) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/10_units/01_pod/02_pod_coverage.t M

    Skip coverage tests for modules that fail to load. They're most
    likely failing because of missing dependencies, and other tests will
    fail if they're actually broken. 

  2006-09-28 04:36:51 (r2138) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/10_units/05_filters/03_http.t M

    Replace an unpack() containing a post-5.6 template character with a
    regular expression that captures text. Improves test compatibility
    with legacy versions of Perl. 

  2006-09-23 16:08:30 (r2137) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Document why this module refuses to run on MSWin32. At least two

    Patch to clean up POD for Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage
    
    Removed one POE::Kernel method: queue_peek_alarms()
    
    Renamed others to internal methods:

    POE::Session::register_state()

    POE::NFA::register_state()

    POE::Wheel::ReadLine::search()

    POE::Kernel::finalize_kernel() 

  2006-09-19 19:45:12 (r2134) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Added sig_chlid(), test case, and documentation. Resolves rt.cpan.org
    18392. Collateral damage: POE::Loop::Event's signal handler callbacks
    have been replaced by POE::Loop::PerlSignals.
    
    Also added keyword expansion metadata to various files that need it.

    Remove the sig() reference count. After this commit, registering a
    sig() handler will not be sufficient to keep a session alive. This
    reverses a design decision that was in place for about nine months. A
    subsequent release will reintroduce the feature, but hopefully in a
    way that doesn't break prior existing code.

    Updated Chris Williams' fine POD tests to more explicitly treat
    certain methods as private. Also added a "strict" mode that doesn't
    skip over the methods temporarily considered private while we figure
    out whether they should really be so. Also removed tabs while I was
    in there. Curse you, tabs!
    
    Removed new() methods from classes that are really uninstantiated
    mixins. Calling a nonexistent method is semantically about the same
    as calling a constructor that only exists to croak. Had to remove
    tests for the croaks as well.
    
    Documented select_pause_read() and select_resume_read().
    
    Added leading underscores to a bunch of helper functions and methods
    that should really have been private. There are more to come, but
    their privacy status is less obvious. 

  2006-09-08 02:56:42 (r2115) by rcaputo; poe/Makefile.PL M

    Remove the disclaimer about needing system's tail for robustness.
    It's only an issue if log files are rotated incorrectly, and in that

    Put the intrflush() call back, and skip all my shiny new tests

    A cheezy hack to avoid destroying Wheel::ReadLine instances from
    within POE::Kernel's space. A proper fix would be to somehow break
    this wheel's circular references to $self so that DESTROY is

    POE::Loop::Gtk doesn't perform I/O callbacks in exactly the same

    IO::Poll I/O callbacks were in a slightly different order than
    select() ones, at least on Cygwin. How did I know? Because one of

    Resolve rt.cpan.org ticket 20990. XS modules define stub functions

    Merely checking for defined(\&CONSTANT) is not good enough because it
    will always be true. One must eval { my $x = &CONSTANT } to see
    whether using the constant is legal. That's what the new code does
    here. Thanks to Eric Rybski for pointing out the problem.

    Switch from exit() to CORE::exit() for testing under Tk. Have the
    test child program exit one of two ways: "got eof" if it truly has
    exited its while(<STDIN>) loop for EOF reasons, or "got alarm" if the
    child process timed out. Also increased the timeout for slow or
    bogged down machines. Unfortunately the @shutdown_expected test times
    out rather than receives "got eof", so now the test is broken. And
    furthermore, it tries to put() after calling shutdown_stdin() which
    seems wrong. Anyway, this test is still broken.

    Tests were failing under Tk because Tk traps exit() and throws a

    Re-instate exception handling from _stop, since we need it or

    Also make signals (except IDLE and ZOMBIE) properly keep sessions
    alive. Previously they only did it sort of half-heartedly, and there
    were cases where sessions could go away despite handling signals.
    
    The IDLE and ZOMBIE signals don't keep sessions alive. Otherwise

    Yuval Kogman discovered two problems in exception throwing for die()

    Make the MSWin32 non-blocking ioctl() call a little more informative.
    Most WinSock error codes are well beyond the normal $! range, so the
    stringy $! always comes back "Unknown error". At least now you also
    get the nummy version, like 10038, which lets you look up the real
    error ("NOT A SOCKET!!").
    
    Also fix a test on MSWin32. It was failing because the handle being
    selected was... NOT A SOCKET!!

    The previous leak fix broke some tests. Shaaaaame! This fixes the
    test breakage by going ahead with the delete $INC{$path} but only if
    the serializer package does not have the methods we need. Upshot? The
    delete() should only happen (and leak) once.

    Stop deleting the freezer module's path from from %INC. While this
    does prompt Perl to fully reload the module, it also introduces a bad
    memory leak when POE::Filter::Reference->new() is called with a
    package name. Given the choice between both bad outcomes, I'll prefer
    the noisy one to the silent but deadly one. This resolvels

    Use POSIX::_exit(0) for the event loop tests when they're run in

    Detabify the test generator. More importantly, turn on autoflush for

  2006-05-21 21:12:55 (r1958) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Filter/HTTPD.pm M

    Don't append a message to the HTTP headers if there isn't one. Avoids
    an excess trailing space in some instances.

  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Updated the filter mechanism again, hopefully I have it right this
    time. This also addresses rt19106.

  2006-05-14 01:43:25 (r1955) by immute; poe/lib/POE/Filter.pm M

    #18665: PoCo::Client::TCP sometimes doesn't send Disconnected
    callback
    
    The reasoning is sane, and the code's updated to send it in the
    special case

  2006-04-24 02:42:14 (r1940) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Filter.pm M

    Add more diagnostic information to tests that are failing under
    ActiveState's build system. 

  2006-04-11 10:06:53 (r1938) by adamkennedy; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Whenever you work with relative time, you have to measure "now"
    absolutely as soon as possible. Moved the time() call from when
    delay_set sets the actual alarm to the very top, which is much closer
    to where the caller meant "now" to mean.

  2006-04-10 23:36:15 (r1937) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Next development version.

    Chris Fedde found a bug in the way Server::TCP creates filters. He
    was kind enough to provide a test case, so I was able to find and fix
    the problem easily. Thank you! 

  2006-04-10 20:37:40 (r1933) by rcaputo; poe/Makefile.PL M

    Fix a bug Rob Bloodgood discovered when installing on 5.5-ish
    systems. The find() subroutines were using next rather than return. 

  2006-04-06 17:58:43 (r1932) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/gen-meta.perl M

    Add the tests directory to the no-index directive. This should stop
    the CPAN indexer's squealing about missing permissions. 

  2006-04-06 16:21:11 (r1931) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    Now at version 0.34_01 so that cpan test reports from svn aren't
    confused with the official release. 

=========================
2006-04-06 16:06:00 v0_34
=========================

  2006-04-06 15:14:24 (r1929) by rcaputo; poe/README M; poe/lib/POE.pm M

    We're 0.34 now. Make some pre-release README tweaks, too.

  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_run.pm M;
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/k_alarms.pm M

    Increase the timing tolerances on some tests. 

  2006-04-06 03:40:26 (r1927) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_sf_udp.pm M

    Beef up error reporting for a sometimes-failing test. 

  2006-04-05 21:30:12 (r1926) by adamkennedy; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Moving a variable inside a scope to save an instruction per event

  2006-04-05 15:05:45 (r1925) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm M

    Slow machines weren't seeing all the flushes. Turns out that the
    driver had a chance to glom together put() calls before the next
    writable event came around. Increased the delay between put() calls
    by an order of magnitude to avoid false test failures. 

  2006-04-05 04:22:47 (r1924) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkCommon.pm M

    Clear the we're-do-one-looping flag when a UIDESTROY signal is
    dispatched due to closing the main window. Otherwise the after()
    event tied to that window never fires (because the window is closed,
    duh), and an application can hang. 

  2006-04-05 04:21:26 (r1923) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm M

    Explain a test result. Sometimes this test fails. It's not
    deterministic, but at least we'll know more about it the next time. 

  2006-04-04 04:19:10 (r1922) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Client/TCP.pm M;
  poe/lib/POE/Component/Server/TCP.pm M

    Matt Sickler patched POE::Component::Client::TCP and the server to
    use POE::Filter::* clone() methods if you pass an object rather than
    a class name to the Filter* parameters. 

  2006-04-02 12:25:53 (r1921) by adamkennedy; poe/lib/POE/Filter/Map.pm M

    Make the POE::Filter::Map synopsis a little more readable

  poe/lib/POE/Filter/Reference.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Filter.pm M

    Matt Sickler added clone() methods to POE::Filter and its subclasses.
    This addresses a large part of rt.cpan.org #4931. 

  2006-04-02 00:33:21 (r1919) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Use the emacs input mode by default. Everybody expects the arrow keys
    to work, and vi power users probably know about .inputrc already.
    
    Get the delete key doing that backward-character-delete thang. 

  2006-04-01 07:37:06 (r1918) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    rt.cpan.org squashes indents in source code and patches, and some
    code made it into this module without indents. Fixed that.
    
    More importantly, document the EDITOR=vi gotcha. If you don't have an
    .inputrc, POE::Wheel::ReadLine checks out your EDITOR environment
    variable for clues as to the mode it uses. As a result, many people
    will get vi editing mode without expecting it. 

  2006-03-29 07:05:40 (r1917) by rcaputo
  poe/tests/30_loops/00_base/wheel_tail.pm M

    Change the test timing to work around Virtual PC's inconsistent
    emulated CPU clock. 

  2006-03-29 04:41:20 (r1916) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Chris Fedde discovered that the "harmless" practice of closing STDIN,
    STDOUT, and STDERR before dup'ing them seems to cause a problem on
    Unix-based systems when the parent process doesn't have stdio handles
    of its own. This commit resolves his rt.cpan.org ticket, #16691. 

  2006-03-29 04:22:22 (r1915) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/Run.pm M

    Chris Fedde, in rt.cpan.org ticket #16691, accidentally discovered a
    case where closing STDOUT and STDERR together, then opening them for
    redirection, was breaking STDIN in child processes. This fixes the
    case, but it does not close his original ticket. I'm committing this
    separately so I can check it out in Windows to make sure I didn't
    just break things there. 

  2006-03-28 21:37:31 (r1914) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Loop/TkActiveState.pm M

    Eliminate a memory leak using Tk with ActiveState Perl. Resolves Ake
    Nilson's rt.cpan.org ticket, number 14301. 

  2006-03-28 06:20:53 (r1913) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/cpan-test.perl M

    Get the regression tester finding and downloading POE component
    tarballs again. CPANPLUS::Backend and ::Config have changed a little
    in the time since I last used this. 

  2006-03-28 05:22:55 (r1912) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Session.pm M

    Upgrade carp() to croak() in the new() constructor. This constructor
    has been deprecated since at least Nov 2004, so I think people have
    had fair warning. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket #8470. 

  2006-03-28 05:15:50 (r1911) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Resource/Statistics.pm M

    Applied Lars' patch to avoid division by zero errors in
    POE::Resource::Statistics. Resolves rt.cpan.org ticket #17017. 

  2006-03-28 05:10:47 (r1910) by rcaputo; poe/mylib/gen-meta.perl M

    Add a no_index entry for the mylib directory. 

  2006-03-28 05:10:09 (r1909) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    Remove some files that shouldn't be there. 

  2006-03-28 04:31:29 (r1908) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M

    Applied Jeff Pinyan's patch to fix tab completion when the only match
    for a prefix is the full string of the match. Prior to the patch,
    Wheel::ReadLine would just ring the terminal bell and not display any
    matches. 

  2006-03-27 17:41:50 (r1907) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST M

    Commit MANIFEST changes. 

  2006-03-23 05:44:47 (r1906) by rcaputo
  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Make some minor syntactical changes to some comments to support a
    side project. 

  2006-03-21 05:58:24 (r1905) by rcaputo; poe/lib/POE/Kernel.pm M

    Try to load POE::XS::Queue::Array before POE::Queue::Array. This
    needs to be made generic somehow. 

  2006-03-21 05:57:34 (r1904) by rcaputo; poe/MANIFEST.SKIP M

    Ignore .svn directories.
